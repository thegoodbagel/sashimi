Channel: A layer of the input, like color layers (RGB)	
    3 channels â†’ R, G, B
Kernel: The actual weights (a small matrix) used for convolution	
    A 3x3 matrix of weights
Filter: A set of kernels (one per input channel), collectively detecting a pattern
    One filter = 3 kernels for RGB input
Feature map: The result after applying a filter to the input
    Output image/layer
