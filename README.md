# 🍣 Sashimi Classifier (WIP)

_A sushi companion for the introverted foodie._

Have you ever wanted to learn about different types of sashimi but felt too shy to ask the chef? This project is for you.

We're building an image classifier to identify different kinds of sashimi—because the ones that are currently out there just doesn’t cut it.

## 🛠️ Project Milestones

~~### Basics~~ ✅

- **Build a basic classifier using PyTorch**

  - Experiment with different architectures
  - Research and document findings
  - Limit to two types of sashimi - salmon and otoro

- **Data Collection**

  - Manually curate and label a dataset
  - Train the initial model

- **Add a Frontend**
  - Let users upload or take pictures
  - Optionally incorporate user-submitted images into the dataset

---

### Desirable Features

- **Expand the Dataset**

  - Include more types of sashimi
  - Explore automation for data gathering

- ## **Extend to Images with Multiple Difference Pieces of Sashimi**

  - Reflect in frontend, attaching labels to each 'group' of fish

- **Add Benchmarking**
  - Measure and improve speed and accuracy
  - Compare model performance over time

---

### Above and Beyond

- Implement unit tests for critical components
- Extend to other types of food:
  - Include descriptors (taste, texture, etc.)
  - Add location-based sushi recommendations (Automated _Beli_?)
