# 🍣 Sashimi Classifier

_A sushi companion for the introverted foodie._

Have you ever wanted to learn about different types of sashimi but felt too shy to ask the chef? This project is for you.

We're building an image classifier to identify different kinds of sashimi—because the ones that are currently out there just doesn’t cut it.
